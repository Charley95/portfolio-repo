# PROJECT 1 - Personal Portfolio Website 

This is a personal portfolio website built to be responsive across all screen sizes. 
The user should be able to:

- see the hover states of the elements in the navigation bar and the contact me icons just above the footer.
- click on the provided links of the listed projects to see the live site.
- quickly navigate to a desired section of the website by clicking the required menu element on the navigation bar.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- Published on GitHub

### Challenges

1. The navbar was built with Bootstrap. I tried using different other methods at first and it was not working.
2. I encountered issues with the layout while trying to position the first image on the right when viewing the website on a large screen.

### Future Improvements
Given more time, I will like to:

1. add an email link to the email icon on the contact section so that users will be able to write and send me a mail by clicking on the button.
